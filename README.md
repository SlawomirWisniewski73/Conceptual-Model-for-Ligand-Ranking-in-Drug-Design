# Conceptual-Model-for-Ligand-Ranking-in-Drug-Design
This paper presents a proof-of-concept framework for rapid, interpretable ligand ranking based on information vector theory and ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The method represents molecular properties (pIC50, selectivity, LogP, molecular weight, TPSA, and metabolic clearance) as vectors.
